# v6 is out!

Fully rewritten with my own shader generator system and my own custom inspector. With a plethora of new feature and bugfixes - the v6 is finally out!

## What's new?

- A fully revamped inspector UI
- VCC support
- Much improved Vertex Animation shader
- **New Toon Shader** based on [XSToon](https://github.com/Xiexe/Xiexes-Unity-Shaders)
- New Shader Generator system that allows extending any of my shaders with a couple of lines of code

## Updating from older versions

This is a breaking change, but all your materials will still work. You just need to follow the migration process [outlined here](/docs/migration/any-to-v6)
