# ðŸŽ² Color Randomisation

Options relevant to the orels1/Standard Color Randomisation shader

-----

This shader provides a quick way to tint a bunch of objects using the same material based on their world position.

In practice, this means that you can duplicate the same mesh many times, move them around, and get a differently colored mesh in each of the spots, see demo below

:::info

While the demo above shows the objects moving, generally speaking you are not expected to move these in runtime, as this shader is primarily an environment design tool

:::

:::caution Do not static batch

Static batching removes correct object origin data, utilize GPU instancing instead

- Color Palette: Controls the tinting, can be any size, but generally it can be as small as possible. It is advise to set it to no compression, point filter and clamp
- Mask By: Controls the masking of the tint, has multiple options
  - Albedo: Uses the main Albedo texture for tint masking. Additional options are provided to filter the albedo data
  - Mask Texture: Uses an extra texture to mask the tinting effect
- Mask Contrast: Only visible when **Mask By** is set to **Albedo**. Allows you to select a subset of the albedo colors as the mask source. See example below
- Randomisation Mask: Only visible when **Mask By** is set to **Mask Texture**. Specifies the texture to be used for the tint masking
- Tint Strength: Controls the intensity of the applied tinting
- Color Boost: Tinting can often darken the original colors. Color boost allows you to lift the gamma of the colors which can help combat that
