:::info Shader Types

Any shader containing **"Standard"** in the name is PBR-based. With everything else being special shaders for VFX and other specific purposes

## Download

### For Any Unity Project

- [ ] [Download and import the lastest full release (the first .unitypackage file)](https://github.com/orels1/orels-Unity-Shaders/releases)
- [ ] All of the shaders should be added under the orels1 category in the shaders list
- [ ] Check out these docs to learn more about the shaders available! Base Shader docs is a good place to start
- [ ] Enjoy!

:::caution
Downloading individual Shaders, Shader Generator, or Shader Inspector packages is not recommended unless you know what you're doing
:::

### For VCC Users

:::info

VCC Listing Coming Soon

:::

- [ ] Add this repo listing to your VCC
```
// future URL here
```
- [ ] Add ORL Shaders package to your project
- [ ] All of the shaders should be added under the orels1 category in the shaders list
- [ ] Check out these docs to learn more about the shaders available! Base Shader docs is a good place to start
- [ ] Enjoy!


:::tip Repo Download

You can also download the repo itself as a ZIP file. You'll need to then take all the folders from the `Packages` beginning with `sh.orels` and put them into your Project's `Packages` folder.

## Update

If you're updating from an old version, most of the time you can just download the latest release and import it on top of the existing version.
There are exceptions for major version upgrades, so check out the [Migration Guides](/docs/migration) section to learn more.

## Demo World

If you're interested in seeing most of the shaders in action, [you can check out this world](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_cea7e89a-1e10-48cc-aace-6feef5978a95&instanceId=0) which uses them for basically everything and has some demos for you to play with!

## Credits

While most of the shaders were written by me (orels1), a lot of the Google Filament-related code is based on the implementations done by z3y and Silent, please check out their shaders too!

- [z3y's Simple Lit](https://github.com/z3y/shaders)
- [Silent's Filamented](https://gitlab.com/s-ilent/filamented)
- [Google Filament source](https://github.com/google/filament)
- [XSToon](https://github.com/Xiexe/Xiexes-Unity-Shaders)

While the above shaders have served as an incredibly well made bases that I drew from to make the PBR setup for the ORL Standard family of shaders, I extended mine with a lot of extra features like Audio Link, Vertex Animations, a simple Glass variant and others.

For building the final shader files in a nice modular way - the ORL Shader Generator is used. It was built by me to solve a very specific problem of needing a flexible shader generation framework which is easy to extend and which is Open Source (and thus easy for other people to use and include in their projects).
It was inspired by [Modular Shader System](https://github.com/VRLabs/Modular-Shader-System/) by VRLabs and BetterShaders by Jason Booth.

Also absolutely gigantic Thank You to the VRC Shader Dev discord for helping me along the way!
