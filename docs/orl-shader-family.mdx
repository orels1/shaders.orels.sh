# ORL Shader Family

> A Filament-based collection of shaders + extras. Pronounced as "orel" (aw-rEl)

:::info Shader Types

Any shader containing **"Standard"** in the name is PBR-based. With everything else being special shaders for VFX and other specific purposes

## Demo World

If you're interested in seeing most of the shaders in action, [you can check out this world](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_cea7e89a-1e10-48cc-aace-6feef5978a95&instanceId=0) which uses them for basically everything and has some demos for you to play with!

## Credits

While most of the shaders were written by me (orels1), a lot of the Google Filament-related code is based on the implementations done by z3y and Silent, please check out their shaders too!

- [z3y's Simple Lit](https://github.com/z3y/shaders)
- [Silent's Filamented](https://gitlab.com/s-ilent/filamented)
- [Google Filament source](https://github.com/google/filament)

While the above shaders have served as an incredibly well made bases that I drew from to make the PBR setup for the ORL Standard family of shaders, I extended mine with a lot of extra features like Audio Link, Vertex Animations, a simple Glass variant and others.

For building the final shader files in a nice modular way - the [Modular Shader System](https://github.com/VRLabs/Modular-Shader-System/) by VRLabs was used. I highly recommend checking it out if you are a shader developer!

Also absolutely gigantic Thank You to the VRC Shader Dev discord for helping me along the way!
