Options relevant to the orels1/Standard Decals shader

---

A simple Decalery-compatible decals shader. It uses a fade + cutout render mode and provides a simple z-offset to avoid z-fighting.

![Decals Inspector](/img/docs/orl-standard/decals/decals.png "Decals Inspector")

## Settings

- Cutoff: Controls the alpha cutoff value
- ZOffset: Controls the z-offset of the decals towards the camera
- Multiply Alpha by Vertex Color: Provides compatibility with Decalery's angle fade feature. Multiplies alpha by the vertex color red channel
