If you’re new to ORL, we recommend you start with the [installation guide](/docs/installation/). It will walk you through the process of setting up the shaders in your project.

If you encounter any issues during the installation process - you can ask for help [in my discord](https://discord.gg/orels1)!

## Quick start

There are a couple of ways to install the shaders depending on the type of your project

### Using the VRChat Creator Companion

Use the button below

{% add-to-vcc /%}

Or add it manually by using the URL below:

```
https://orels1.github.io/orels-Unity-Shaders/index.json
```

If you're not familiar with how to add new repositories to the VCC - [check out the VCC docs](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/guides/community-repositories).

Open the Project Management screen for your project and add the "ORL Shaders" package.

You should be able to see all the shaders in your shaders list under the "orels1" category!

For more detailed installation instructions check out the [installation](/docs/installation/) page.

### Learning about the shaders

You can find documentation for all of the shaders in the [shader list](/shaders/) or via the search bar on the top of the scren.

### Combining features

In case you want to combine multiple shaders together - you can use [Configurable Shaders](/docs/configurable-shaders) to do so. This allows you to assemble an Uber shader with the featres you want.

### Getting Updates

If you're updating from an old version, most of the time you can just get the latest release the same way you got the original package and that's it. There are exceptions for major version upgrades, so check out the [Migration Guides](/docs/migration) section to learn more.

## Getting help

You can check out the [Frequently Asked Questions section](/docs/faq) to see if your question is already answered there.

Otherwise, if you're still having trouble with the shaders, you can ask for help in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/orels1).

If you are a shader developer yourself and want to file a code-specific issue with a bit more detail, drop by the github repo and [submit an issue there](https://github.com/orels1/orels-Unity-Shaders/issues/new)!
